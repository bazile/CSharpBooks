# Debugger

**Hitting F10** to build, run, and attach debugger instead of F5 will automatically break on the first time your own code is being executed. No breakpoints needed.

Supported from Visual Studio 2005


**Reattach to process** (Shift+Alt+P) is extremely helpful when you have to attach to the same process again and again.
